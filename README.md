This is a job to automate data uploads for a Shiny app. 

The idea is to run this script once a day via the Git action, and save the files in CSV format. If we make the repo public, we can then use the data from the raw link, for example: 
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gallochris/wab_data_job/main/data/played_sched_rtg.csv`

This can be helpful when using for other functions and reading through the Shiny app.
